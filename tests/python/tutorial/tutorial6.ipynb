    "# PyMem3DG Tutorial 6 - Extended Applications 2: protein dynamics\n",
    "`Cuncheng Zhu, Christopher T. Lee`\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers how `Mem3DG` models protein dynamics. In previous tutorials, we have been focusing on the mechanics of membrane in response to current configuration and material properties, while the other side of the coin is the chemical response: how protein density $\\phi$ respond to the condition? \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as the mechanical force that drives the shape evolution, chemical potential drives the protein evolution. They are the shape variation and chemical variation of the free energy, respectively. The tutorial aims to provide the fundamental and practical API maniputation. Please refer to the documentation and publication for details of the theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate, this tutorial will model the protein evolution on a realistic dendritic spine model processed using GAMer(https://github.com/ctlee/gamer). Instead of evolving the shape of the geometry, we evolve the protein distribution on a given geometry. The dynamics of protein will be governed by curvature-sensing property of membrane-bound protein, in-plane diffusion of membrane protein, as well as out-of-plane protein-membrane adsorption. "
