Please refer to the documentation for detailed explanation of various entries. Below we shows the simulation setup for a homogeneous membrane undergoing osmotic shrinkage, which is a classic solution of the *shape equation* that results in the biconcave shape similar to the red blood cell. Because of the simplicity of the setup, we only specify essential physical quantities such as the bending rigidity, stretching modulus and bulk modulus, assuming the default  and omitting the majority of the parameters. \n",
